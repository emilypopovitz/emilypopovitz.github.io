  <div class="grid-item">Heather Chadwell of the VH1's Rock of Love discusses her experience with reality tv and how it would exist in today's world. I had the pleasure of speaking with her on the way women were treated and why this could not be part of television in present time. <p> Interview by Emily Popovitz</p></div>

  <div class="grid-item1"> How did you get on Rock of Love? <p > I knew once I moved out West (from Ohio) I wanted to do this. I was doing extra work and was with a talent agency. I was shit faced drunk on The Surreal Life, then two months later the same producers messaged on MySpace and thought I'd be perfect for a dating show with 20 girls and an 80s rocker, we didn’t know who wey were there to date beforehand. I said sign me up “I’m single and living the party lifestyle (at the time)” People think this happens overnight, I started pageants at 13 and was building my confidence and it just has to be the right place at the right time” </p></div>

  <div class="grid-item2"> Once the show ended, what was life like for you? <p >

The show took months to air. Right after, “I felt traumatized and really heartbroken, embarrassed, and exploited” Now I don’t mind, but my family was going to see me taking my top off and smashing guitars. Luckilyy my family is cool and I am my own person and I am going to do what I want to do. After it aired and I felt the love from everyone it made me feel more comfortable with the outcome originally. </p></div>


<br><div class="grid-item3"> How did it feel to have an audience? <p >

Pretty good, I feel like I’ve always been destined for entertainment. I grew up doing multiple sports and there was always an audience, this was just with television. My life kind of prepared me for reality tv and when it hit I was all about it. </p></div>

<br><div class="grid-item4"> Did you notice you had a fanbase copying your attitude? <p >

Yes which was super cool. I like to inspire people, I welcome that. But also I saw some cast members down the road turning against me. Cast members I met prior to the show would turn on me. It's cool with fans but not when people mimicked me and then turned on me. Women are women. I’m all women having each others backs and help each other out, sometimes people just flip on you. </p></div>



<div class="grid-item5"> What do you think the show would be like filmed now? <p >

I've been sober for three years so it would be completely different for me. I’ve grown and matured a lot. I don’t think the good type of entertainment that got out of me back then would happen now, it was just from drinking vodka and Red Bull. Knowing what I kno now I don’t think I would have put forth all this love and energy to a dating show on tv because I just know how they are now and I’ve grown. If it were a different kind of reality show on something I’m passionate about I would be all for it, for example, real estate, not some guy trying to have a show to revamp his career and use a bunch of women in the process. </p></div>



<div class="grid-item6"> Do you think if a show like Rock of Love happened now how do you think that would look or exist? Especially with social media. <p >

We paved the way for all the Housewive shows. We made it okay to get drunk and rowdy and make great tv. I still feel like it would be good. This day and age we’re so used to being entertained immediately. It would be more taming and the people would get bigger because when we did this there was no Instagram, Twitter, or Snapchat. We didn’t have that, that's the only downfall for being the pioneer because we didn’t have these extra sites to promote and get more jobs, we had to do this ourselves. </p></div>





<br><div class="grid-item7"> With the way people acted and communicated in the early 2000s, do you think it would be the same today? <p >

I think it would be monitored. People wouldn’t go full forced and with the Me Too movement I don’t think a lot of women who have especially dealt with sexual assault and grimy men, would want to see guys howling at women and saying “that turns me on” women think that's gross. It's not attractive doing the same thing with women after women and its not admirable or respectable for women of this era and I don’t know if it would fly in that sense. </p></div>
